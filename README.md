# Music Store Database

## Overview

This repository contains SQL scripts for a Music Store Database, designed to solve a range of real-life problems, from beginner to advanced levels. The project covers various scenarios you might encounter when working with a music store's database, including data retrieval, aggregation, complex queries, and performance optimization.

## Project Structure

- **SQL Scripts:** All the SQL queries are organized within the `music_database_analysis.sql` file.
- **Database Schema:** The database includes several tables representing different aspects of a music store, such as `Albums`, `Artists`, `Customers`, `Sales`, and more.

## Features

### Beginner Level

- **Simple SELECT Queries:** Basic data retrieval using `SELECT` statements.
- **Filtering Data:** Using `WHERE` clauses to filter records based on various conditions.
- **Sorting Results:** Ordering query results using `ORDER BY`.

### Intermediate Level

- **Joins:** Combining data from multiple tables using `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, etc.
- **Grouping and Aggregation:** Using `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions like `COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG` to analyze data.
- **Subqueries:** Writing subqueries to solve more complex data retrieval challenges.

### Advanced Level

- **Complex Joins:** Handling complex scenarios with multiple joins and relationships.
- **Performance Optimization:** Indexing strategies and query optimizations to improve performance.
- **Window Functions:** Utilizing window functions to perform calculations across a set of table rows related to the current row.
- **Stored Procedures and Triggers:** Implementing stored procedures and triggers for automation and enforcing business rules.
